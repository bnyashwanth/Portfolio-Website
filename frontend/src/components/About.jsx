<div className="glass-card">
  <p>
    I'm Yashwanth, a{" "}
    <strong>Software Development Engineer Intern</strong> at{" "}
    <strong>Yugayatra</strong> and a second-year undergraduate in{" "}
    <strong>Robotics and Artificial Intelligence</strong> at{" "}
    <strong>Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering</strong>. I specialize in
    building scalable, real-world applications using the{" "}
    <strong>MERN stack</strong>, with a strong focus on backend systems and APIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside full-stack development, I actively explore{" "}
    <strong>AI-powered systems</strong> by integrating{" "}
    <strong>Large Language Model (LLM) APIs</strong> into production-ready
    applications. I have built and deployed a personal AI chatbot using{" "}
    <strong>Hugging Face</strong>, which introduced me to the foundations of{" "}
    <strong>Agentic AI</strong>—systems capable of task planning, tool usage, and
    contextual memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    I continuously strengthen my fundamentals in{" "}
    <strong>Data Structures</strong>, <strong>Algorithms</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, while working on practical
    projects that bridge academic learning with real-world impact. I enjoy
    collaborating with engineers and building technology that solves meaningful
    problems.
