My name is B N Yashwanth, a developer specializing in MERN Stack Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I am currently pursuing a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore (2024–2028). I am also working as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Yugayatra, where I contribute to building real-world, production-grade applications.

I began my development journey in January 2025 with Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB). During this phase, I built foundational projects such as weather applications, to-do apps, and portfolio websites, which helped me strengthen my understanding of frontend and backend fundamentals. Over time, I expanded into Competitive Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and later into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I enjoy merging AI with Web Technologies, focusing on building intelligent, interactive, and scalable systems. As part of this journey, I built and deployed a personal AI assistant using Python and Gradio, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, and later integrated it into my MERN-based portfolio through a custom animated chat interface. This project introduced me to Agentic AI concepts, including task planning, conversational memory, and API-driven system design.

Recently, I have focused on complex system integrations, moving from Streamlit prototypes to robust React + Flask architectures, and solving advanced algorithmic challenges in Java.
